OpenAPI v3 Specification for the Lamden network.

This `spec.yaml` file outlines how to interact with the Lamden blockchain as a client. To view in an interactive editor, go to http://editor.swagger.io/ and paste the `spec.yaml` code. You should be able to see the routes available to all clients. You can also use the Swagger Editor to generate clients for the programming language you need.

This spec is still under development. It is not completely reflective of the protocol, and the protocol is being modified to be OpenAPI v3 compliant.
